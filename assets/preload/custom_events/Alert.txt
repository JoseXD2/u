Value1 = Type of KB's attack    Value2 = Attack length
0 = Normal Attack    1 = Double Attack
2 = Kidding Attack    3 = Triple Attack
4 = Cuad Attack
Value2 is 1 for normal length, 2 for half length,
3 for one-third length...
and so on for any number greater than or equal to one.
It also supports decimals.
In this case, 0.5 is twice the length.
